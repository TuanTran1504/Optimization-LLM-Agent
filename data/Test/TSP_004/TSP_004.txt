Delivery Route Optimization Problem

A logistics company needs to determine the most efficient route for a delivery van to visit Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C.
 The goal is to minimize the total travel distance, while respecting delivery timing windows and vehicle capacity constraints.

Start and End Points: The route must start in Boston and end in Washington D.C.

Timing Constraints:

Washington D.C. must be visited before 12:00 PM (noon).

Philadelphia must be visited after 2:00 PM.

Capacity Constraint:

The van can carry up to 200 units.

Delivery demands are:

Boston = 30 units

New York = 50 units

Philadelphia = 100 units

Washington D.C. = 20 units
